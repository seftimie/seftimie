### Hello,

My name is Silviu Daniel Eftimie, I’m a Madrid-based **professional Data Engineer** / **Senior Software Developer** at [BMIND](https://bmind.es/), a **lifelong learner**, a proud **father** ([1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHV6pF1KjgCJB4M__4ZYISg/videos) | [2](https://twitter.com/silviueftimie/status/1243964087329054721) ) and **teacher** at [Edix Unir](https://www.edix.com/es/carreras/carreras-growth-marketing/) . 

I like books (paper format) - they are my daily dose of inspiration.  Sometimes I write. I keep in touch and let myself be guided by a number of people.

Retrospectively analyzing, when I was 4 years old I used to express myself through building. This became a passion. Later I understood that passion cannot be nurtured without a principle. When I realized that **as a programmer you don't need anything more than a computer to create**, I began to convert ideas into digital tools that allow people to understand and solve problems.

### GOALS:
- **Short-term**: finding a working environment able to assess, develop and use my skills, creativity and knowledge that I have accumulated over time. I think that spending a great deal of your life at work and choosing energy in where and who you work with is always a good investment.
- **Long-term**: developing a digital mentor.

### TALKS:

- As a Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer, I've presented for different clients all the Google Cloud Solution for Big Data and Machine Learning;
- I'm one of the teachers at Edix, [Growth Marketing -> Tecnologías de Big Data a Servicio del Marketing Digital](https://www.edix.com/es/carreras/carreras-growth-marketing/) , [Organizer announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/salvatorecospito_carrera-en-growth-marketing-convi%C3%A9rtete-activity-6717097742725918720-Dl_e/), [Personal announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eftimiesilviudaniel_carrera-en-growth-marketing-convi%C3%A9rtete-activity-6711248556960821248-3-Gu/) 
- In august 2020, I founded TF Team / Group: 14 members, from 5 different companies with the main scope to learn together TensorFlow and pass the exam. For more details please consult: [First breakthrough](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eftimiesilviudaniel_tensorflow-coursera-machinelearning-activity-6716249834870849536-1g4F/), [my progress with TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://github.com/seftimie/TensorFlowJourney)
- Talk at BMind, “Firebase - A game changer”  collaboration with [Christian Stoyanov](https://github.com/crissto);


### PROJECTS (some relevant work, from last 3 years):

- **SAS (Smart Analytics Solutions)**: using several Google Cloud Platform products, I have managed to set up a serverless, measurement solution in cloud (using Cloud Functions/Cloud Run + PubSub + BigQuery and some solutions from open source community: Great Expectations, Snowplow, StreamProcessor).  

- **YTA**: A visual data workflow orchestration service, serverless, multi cloud platform (gcp, aws, azure and on premise) capable of ingest, transform and process data at scale without writing code (although for custom jobs, you can use plain python/bash/sql). By myself, I have created the solution working on all its aspects: frontend, backend, architecture, deployment.  In Digital Marketing it’s useful for cases like: Easy integrate your cloud applications or multiple systems; Automate marketing, sales and business processes without writing code; Transformation and pre-processing of data at scale using cloud tech; Supports many integrations & connectors

- **ML Solution**: I've designed and worked for RTVE, using Google Cloud ML solutions : "Making valuable content accessible to international audiences". [Case study here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bmind-a-sales-maker-company-s-l-_caso-de-%C3%A9xito-activity-6711965890105151488-yDh7/).
	
- **Banking: Abandoned cart (pre-Granted Loans solution)**: in real time detect and inform the Call Center about any user when they exit the process of contracting a loan without having finished it. The Call Center connects in less than 1 min with the users, assisting them for completion of the process. My part was to integrate the Call Center with Salesforce Marketing Cloud (sending them all info, in real time).  In the past, the client would generate a report every day with users who have not finished the process (the day before) and they would pass that report to the call centers. 


- **Media: Digital Asset Management**: I've built an AI-Powered Searchable Video Platform Archive using Google Cloud Machine Learning solutions (Natural Language, Video AI, Speech to Text, Cloud Translation). The platform would analyze in parallel lots of video, extracting & storing metadata and generating subtitles.  

- **Teachable Machine 4 Youtube/Netflix** ([code](https://github.com/seftimie/TeachableMachine4YoutubeNetflix)): Open source demo, using machine learning to play/pause videos from distance on Youtube, Netflix or HBO in a hacky way. I've been using Teachable Machine (from Google AI Experiments), some Javascript and Chrome Developer Tools. Now, this project it’s part of “[The Awesome Teachable Machine List](https://github.com/SashiDo/awesome-teachable-machine)”

### Hello,

My name is Silviu Daniel Eftimie, I’m a Madrid-based **professional Data Engineer** / **Senior Software Developer** at [BMIND](https://bmind.es/), a **lifelong learner**, a **father** ([1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHV6pF1KjgCJB4M__4ZYISg/videos) | [2](https://twitter.com/silviueftimie/status/1243964087329054721) ) and **teacher** at [Edix Unir](https://www.edix.com/es/carreras/carreras-growth-marketing/) . 

I like books (paper format) - they are my daily dose of inspiration.  Sometimes I write. I keep in touch and let myself be guided by a number of people.

Retrospectively analyzing, when I was 4 years old I used to express myself through building. This became a passion. Later I understood that passion cannot be nurtured without a principle. When I realized that **as a programmer you don't need anything more than a computer to create**, I began to convert ideas into digital tools that allow people to understand and solve problems.

### Goals
- **Short-term**: finding a working environment able to assess, develop and exploit my skills, creativity and knowledge that I have accumulated over time. I think that spending a great deal of your life at work and choosing energy in where and who you work with is always a good investment.
- **Long-term**: developing a digital mentor.

### Talks and trainings:
-  Using Google Cloud Platform, AI (ML apis, AutoML, Tables, BigQuery ML, TensorFlow) for some customers;
-  Firebase - A game changer at BMIND; (collabo with [Christian Stoyanov](https://github.com/crissto));

### Projects:
- As a side project, using several Google Cloud Platform products, I have managed to set up my **own serverless, measurement solution in cloud** (using Cloud Functions / Cloud Run + BigQuery);
- I have created a **visual, serverless, multi cloud platform** (gcp, aws, azure and on premise) capable of **ingest, transform and process data at scale**. It’s useful for cases in Digital Marketing: Integrate your cloud applications, automate marketing, sales and business processes, integrate multiple systems (aws, azure, gcp, salesforce, dmps, client world etc). The solution is similar to CRMint, Data Fusion;
